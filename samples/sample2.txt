Never asked to be reborn, or submit unto their norm
Don't you ever tell me how to live my life
For rebellion I am armed, all my senses are alarmed
Decimate this mental breed that I despise
For this system I can't trust, in these ruins of arrogance
My saviors are destroyers to some
Here I stand
With both my hands untied
Hate über Alles, Hate über Alles
Hate über Alles - Hate is the virus of this world
Hate über Alles, Hate über Alles
Hate über Alles - Hate is the virus of this world
I'm a wanderer of the storm, live to win, not follow, bow
I'm an entity on a human journey
For my Reich's not of this world, I reject the empires gold
For the purest liberty my heart is yearning
No distraction, no regrets, slay the guardians at the gates
For this cult was never meant to compromise
Here I stand
With both my hands untied
Hate über Alles, Hate über Alles
Hate über Alles - Hate is the virus of this world
Hate über Alles, Hate über Alles
Hate über Alles - Hate is the virus of this world
I don't see what they see
I don't believe what they believe
Whatever comes, I am fearless
I don't want what they want
I hold my ground right at the front
My hate they shall feel it
They shall feel it!
Hate über Alles, Hate über Alles
Hate über Alles - Hate is the virus of this world
Hate über Alles, Hate über Alles
Hate über Alles - Hate is the virus of this world
Hate über Alles, Hate über Alles
Hate über Alles - Hate is the virus of this world
Hate über Alles, Hate über Alles
Hate über Alles - Hate is the virus of this world
